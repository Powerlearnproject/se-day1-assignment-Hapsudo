Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the engineering which invlolves design,development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software. It is important because promotes innovation, enhances data security, improves productivity and ensures software reliability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Software Engineering 1968-NATO Conference. This is where software engineering was introduced where many software projects failed which included lack of structured processes, system comoplexity and poor planning 
2. The rise of Object Oriented Programming - 1980s. This is whre OOP arised to help in system scalability, reusability and mantainability of coding.
3. The rise of Agile and DevOps 2001 - Present. This period introduced agike development of programs which encourages flexible and iterative software development as opposed to limitations of traditional methods like waterfall. Addditionally DevOps emerged to promote collaboration between developers and operations to enable faster and reliable software delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - Define the scope, goals and feasibility of your project.
2. Requirement analysis - Idenity and document all your requiremnts for the functional and non-functional of the software.
3. Design - create a system architecture and detailed design specifications of the system which includes the programming languages and databases to be used.
4. Implementation - Here is where coding of the system happens.
5. Testing - Identify, test and fix error from the software developed in stage four.
6. Deployment - Releas the software in a live environment.
7. Maintenance and support - Continuously offer support post-deployment by addressing user challengs and monitoring the system for any bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
